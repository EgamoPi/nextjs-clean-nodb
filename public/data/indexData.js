	paragraphTwo: `We are located in Kokrobite, a fishing village about 30Km west of Accra.`,

	paragraphTwoBis: `Dizzy Lizzies is THE place to be if you are seeking for relaxing & unforgettable experience.`,

	paragraphThree: `The restaurant offers both a local and continental menu, and the bar can provide you with cocktails, healthy smoothies, fresh juices & other beverages. Our rooms are en-suite, clean, airy and bright. We pride ourselves on the professional service we give to our roomers. The team will help you relax and feel at home!`,

	paragraphFour: `Dizzy Lizzies started in 2013; after that, I bought the bare beach land, working out of a kiosk on the beach with two tables.
  Working alone until we got known, I used to make and serve fresh juices, tea, coffee, sandwiches, and chips.`,

	paragraphFourBis: `I built a small bar from bamboo and used a small fridge and ice chest, selling beer and local drinks.
  This is how we managed, expanding the kiosk and our customers until we were a pretty popular spot!
  Our specialities were live band music, drumming, dancing, and bonfire parties on the beach.`,

	paragraphFive: `The team grew from me alone to six working from the kiosk.
  The summer huts along the beach were changed three times for improvement, starting with palm leaves and bamboo supports, to bamboo huts that everyone used to bang their heads on (not suitable for business)! To the raised wooden decking summer hut we have now, which people love.`,

	paragraphFiveBis: `Weâ€™ve managed to make enough money by 2015 to put down foundations for the Dizzy Lizzies everyone knows today. Before long, I had a kitchen built because we outgrew the kiosk and a posh new bar and restaurant!
  Two guest rooms followed, and I trained a team of 14 extraordinary workers.`,
